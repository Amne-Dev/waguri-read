# Waguri Read

This repository exists purely for learning and educational purposes. It serves as a sandbox to experiment with web presentation techniques, automation scripts, and tooling around panel-based storytelling formats.

I chose *The Fragrant Flower That Blooms with Dignity* because the story genuinely touched me, and I wanted to do it justice through a respectful, fan-made website experience.
